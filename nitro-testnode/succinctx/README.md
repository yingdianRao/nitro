# Succinct

Succinct is where the developer community collaborates on applications, proof systems and proving infrastructure to build the future of ZK.

This repository is a monorepo of Succinct's core protocol and several open-source ZK libraries that make writing circuits easier: `plonky2x`, `circomx` and `gnarkx`. You can deploy circuits written with these libraries on the [Succinct Platform](https://alpha.succinct.xyz/). Read more about Succinct [here](https://blog.succinct.xyz/introducing-succinct/).
